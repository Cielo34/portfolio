          Hi there! My name is Anahi, a frontend devloper. I was born the coldest day of 1987 in Germany and grew up in Argentina. I've studied Audiovisual Media and then specialized in the field of 2d animation, then I got capptivated by the world of coding. I've studied for 2 years now. I'm looking forward to keep improoving my knowledge. By now, my skills are: <span class="blueText"> REACT HTML CSS JAVA SCRIPT SASS GIT GITHUB BOOTSTRAP. </span> Besides I come from design fields I can also manage <span class="orangeText"> PHOTOSHOP, ILLUSTRATOR, AFTER EFFECTS, PREMIERE, LIGHTROOM.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that a strong sense of empathy is one of the most important skills that are necessary to build a successful teamwork. Fortunately I was gifted since child with this ability. I enjoy to collaborate and be part of something bigger beyond myself.
          My place in the sun: meeting people from different countries and get diversal points of view of the world we are living in. Diversity is the base of a rich world.
          As a teammate I try to have fun while working and solve problems by communicating.
        </p>
